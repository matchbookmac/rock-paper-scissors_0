As in the game

## The method 

The method `beats?()` is called on one player's play, and the other player's play is taken by that method as an ~~argument~~ parameter.

## The site

Players enter their plays as either `player 1` or `player 2` on the (/plays) page. Clicking submit, will direct you to the (/outcome) page where you can find out who won.
